# Notes on programming using Ruby

Here I will describe my journey in learning the Ruby programming language.
The book I use is "Programming Ruby" (The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide).
This repository is regularly updated with personal notes and some
programs as well.


## Ruby as an object oriented language

* Unlike other languages, everything in Ruby is an object, including
  return values of methods
* Class is a comnination of state (variables) and functions that use
  that state (methods)
* **Object = class instance**, created using a constructor method (.new)
* Every object has unique ID, state is held by instance variables,
  instance methods work on instance variables
* Methods are invoked by sending a message to the receiver object
  (method name, parameters); using parentheses() is a good idea, though
  they are optional, i.e. `puts "Hello"` is the same as `puts("Hello")`
* The value returned by a Ruby method is the value of the last
  expression evaluated, unless `return` is used!
* The `nil` object is an object that represents nothing


## Ruby syntax rules

* Names in lowercase: local_variables, method_names, method_parameters
  * They can also start with an underscore `_`
  * Method names may end with `? ! =`
* Names in uppercase:
  * $global_variables, @local_variables, @@class_variables
    * After the sign(s), they can also start with an underscore `_`
  * Class_names, Module_names, Constants - Uppercase!


## String objects

* Strings are objects whose value is an array of characters; since they
  are objects, they have methods
* Stings surrounded with '' incur less processing than those with "",
  the latter tell Ruby to perform substitutions on escape sequences,
  so `puts '\n'` will print `\n` and `puts "\n"` will print a new line
* Expression interpolation: `"#{name}"` within a string is replaced with
  the value of the "name" expression, `puts "The time is #{Time.now}."`
  * Be careful, it does not work with strings within 'single quotes'!


## String objects methods

* Method `.length` returns number of characters in a string array; works
  properly with Unicode characters, tested with Cyrillic letters
* Method `.index("char_or_string")` returns the position of the first
  occurence of the parameter (a character or a string)
  * Works on arrays, too
  * Counting of position starts from 0 for the first character, like C
* Method `.capitalize` returns the string with first letter in capital


## Number objects

* Numbers can be whole (integers, 27) and decimal (floating point, 3.14)


## Number object methods

* Methods `.odd?` and `.even?` return a boolean value (true/false),
  depending on whether the number object is odd or even


## Arrays

* Arrays and hashes are indexed collections of objects
* Arrays are more efficient to work with, and hashes provide flexibility
* Arrays can be accessed using integers as keys:
  `a = [3.14, 2, "lol"] ; a[0] #=> 3.14`
  * Indices start at zero, so the first element is `a[0]`!
* Arrays can be defined using two notations:
  * `a = [3.14, 2, "lol"]`
  * `b = %w{ dog cat 27 342 673.99 just\ in\ case you\ noticed }`
    * Be careful with this: all of these values will be treated as
      strings, numbers included; spaces in strings must be escaped if
      you want them to be treated as one element of the array
    * Avoid using '' and "" quotes to surround the string or they
      will become part of it, or part of the first and last word
* If an index does not exist, when you access it it returns `nil`


## Hashes

* Hashes can be accessed by using an object as an key, unlike arrays
* Defining a hash:
```ruby
instruments = {
  'guitar' => 'string',
  'trumpet' => 'brass',
  'drum' => 'percussion',
  'saxophone' => 'brass',
  'violin' => 'string'
}
```
* Here, the thing to the left of the `=>` arrow is the key, and the
  thing to the right is its value, like in a dictionary or a phone book:
  name => prone number, English word => Serbian word, etc.
* The keys are unique and must not repeat!
* Accessing a value of a hash's element (indexing it) is the same as in
  arrays: `instruments["guitar"] #=> string`
* If you index a hash with a key that does not match any of the given
  ones, it returns `nil`; you can avoid this by assigning a default
  value when creating a hash: `instruments = Hash.new("none")`


## Symbols
* Symbols are constant names (enums in C) that are guaranteed to be
  unique and they don't need to be predeclared
* The name of a symbol starts with a colon : `:cookie`
* You don't have to assign it a value and Ruby makes sure the symbol
  has the same value no matter where you use it
* Frequently used with hashes, since keys must be unique:
```ruby
instruments = {
  :guitar => 'string',
  :trumpet => 'brass',
  :drum => 'percussion',
  :saxophone => 'brass',
  :violin => 'string'
}
```
* There is an alternative, shorthand syntax that does the same thing:
```ruby
instruments = {
  guitar: 'string',
  trumpet: 'brass',
  drum: 'percussion',
  saxophone: 'brass',
  violin: 'string'
}
```
