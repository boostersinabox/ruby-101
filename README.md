# Notes on programming using Ruby

Here I will describe my journey in learning the Ruby programming language.
The book I use is "Programming Ruby" (The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide).
This repository will be regularly updated with personal notes and code
from the examples, as well as my own simple (and in the future, not so simple)
programs.


## Ruby as an object oriented language

* Unlike other languages, everything in Ruby is an object, including
  return values of methods
* Class is a comnination of state (variables) and functions that use
  that state (methods)
* **Object = class instance**, created using a constructor method (.new)
* Every object has unique ID, state is held by instance variables,
  instance methods work on instance variables
* Methods are invoked by sending a message to the receiver object
  (method name, parameters); using parentheses() is a good idea, though
  they are optional, i.e. `puts "Hello"` is the same as `puts("Hello")`
* The value returned by a Ruby method is the value of the last
  expression evaluated, unless `return` is used!


## Ruby syntax rules

* Names in lowercase:
  * local_variables, method_names, method_parameters
    * They can also start with an underscore `_`
    * Method names may end with `? ! =`
* Names in uppercase:
  * $global_variables, @local_variables, @@class_variables
  * Class_names, Module_names, Constants - Uppercase!


## String objects

* Strings are objects whose value is an array of characters; since they
  are objects, they have methods
* Stings surrounded with '' incur less processing than those with "",
  the latter tell Ruby to perform substitutions on escape sequences,
  so `puts '\n'` will print `\n` and `puts "\n"` will print a new line
* Expression interpolation: "#{name}" within a string is replaced with
  the value of the "name" expression, `puts "The time is #{Time.now}."`
  * Be careful, it does not work with strings within single quotes! ''


## Sting objects methods

* Method ".length" returns number of characters in a string array; works
  properly with Unicode characters, tested with Cyrillic letters
* Method ".index("char_or_string")" returns the position of the first
  occurence of the parameter (a character or a string)
  * Works on arrays, too
  * Counting of position starts from 0 for the first character, like C
* Method ".capitalize" returns the string with first letter in capital


## Number objects

* Methods ".odd?" and ".even?" return a boolean value (true/false),
  depending on whether the number object is odd or even
